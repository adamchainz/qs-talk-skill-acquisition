\begin{slide}

    \textcolor{blue}{\Large{Skill Acquisition}}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item I have been re-learning a skill recently
        \item I tracked myself doing it
        \item This is the story...
    \end{itemize}

\end{slide}



\begin{slide}

    \textcolor{blue}{\Large{The Skill}}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item A puzzle for you...
    \end{itemize}

    % - something you did today
    % - you've been paid to do it
    % - you've probably never practiced it in your life

    % no, it's not making tea...

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

    \textcolor{blue}{\Large{Motivation}}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item I'm a programmer - I have a lot of typing to do!
        \item Fear of RSI - both Mum and colleague have both been crippled by it
        % \item Always \emph{intended} to learn to touchtyping
        \item Stat: ``In the USA, carpal tunnel syndrome results in an average of \$30,000 in lifetime costs'' (Wikipedia)
    \end{itemize}

\end{slide}


\begin{slide}

    \textcolor{blue}{\Large{To business!}}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Just need to grab some typing programs
        \item Get down to learning QWERTY the \emph{right} way!!
    \end{itemize}

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}

    \textcolor{blue}{\Large{Under-motivation}}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Didn't know how long it would take
        \item Relative size of advantage
        \item Hard practicing QWERTY \emph{the right way} at night, then going back to old habits during the day
    \end{itemize}

\begin{slide}

    \textcolor{blue}{\Large{The First 20 Hours : Rapid Summary}}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Nearly any skill can be learnt to a useful degree in 20 hours
        \item A couple chapters of general how-to, then one chapter on each skill he learnt with his method
        \item One of these was on touchtyping... in `Colemak'
    \end{itemize}

\end{slide}


\begin{slide}

    \textcolor{blue}{\Large{QWERTY}}

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=20cm]{qwerty}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item ``Slowly took over the world'', since 1872. Main design constraint: to stop typewriter key bars jamming.
    \end{itemize}

\end{slide}


\begin{slide}

    \textcolor{blue}{\Large{DVORAK}}

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=20cm]{dvorak}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item 1932 attempt at optimisation. Relatively hard to learn.
    \end{itemize}

\end{slide}


\begin{slide}

    \textcolor{blue}{\Large{Colemak}}

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=20cm]{colemak-annot}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Designed by a programmer with mathematical models. Split between ease of transition (Q,W,Z,X,C,V stay the same) and optimization.
    \end{itemize}

\end{slide}


\begin{slide}

    \textcolor{blue}{\Large{Method}}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Swap keys on OS and keyboard
        \item Get some training programs
        \item Fire away
    \end{itemize}

\end{slide}


\begin{slide}

    \textcolor{blue}{\Large{Method}}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Swap keys on OS and keyboard
        \item Get some training programs
        \item Try to practice in 20 minute + sessions, before bed.
    \end{itemize}

\end{slide}


\begin{slide}

    \textcolor{blue}{\Large{Programs}}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item A good mix of programs is useful
        \item Practice different subskills - hardest keys, whole prose, etc.
        \item Data export - not much of a feature here. Many record your WPM + accuracy, but hard to know
    \end{itemize}
