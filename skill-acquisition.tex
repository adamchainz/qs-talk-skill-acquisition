    % - you've been paid to do it
    % - you've probably never practiced it in your life

    \textcolor{blue}{\Large{Motivation}}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item I'm a programmer - I have a lot of typing to do!
        \item Fear of RSI - both Mum and colleague have both been crippled by it
        % \item Always \emph{intended} to learn to touchtyping
        \item Stat: ``In the USA, carpal tunnel syndrome results in an average of \$30,000 in lifetime costs'' (Wikipedia)
    \end{itemize}

\end{slide}


\begin{slide}

    \textcolor{blue}{\Large{To business!}}

        \item Get down to learning QWERTY the \emph{right} way!!
    \end{itemize}

    \textcolor{blue}{\Large{Under-motivation}}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Didn't know how long it would take
        \item Relative size of advantage
        \item Hard practicing QWERTY \emph{the right way} at night, then going back to old habits during the day
    \end{itemize}

\begin{slide}

    \textcolor{blue}{\Large{So what changed?}}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item A book

\begin{slide}

    \textcolor{blue}{\Large{The First 20 Hours}}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Learning a skill shouldn't take more than 20 hours to get to a good enough standard
        \item A couple chapters of general how-to, then one chapter on each skill he learnt with his method
        \item One of these was touchtyping... with `Colemak'
