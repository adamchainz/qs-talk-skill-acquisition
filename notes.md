Typing talk
===========

* records
    * using calendar lifelog utility, all on google cal with #typing
    * Notable I tried to get better with qwerty back in sept but only N hours before giving up - it was very hard to erase old habits, undermotivating with no clear goal or time constraint

* combined chart - practice + score

* why is it a good skill to practice?
    * Compulsive due to fast feedback loop.
    * Other skills I enjoy are similar: programming, music production

* Tools used
    * amphetype, type fu, keyzen, typeocalypse, type racer
    * pie chart breakdown?

* focus on accuracy

* suggestions for better quantification:
    * open database (amphetype able to get out but eg type fu no feature)
    * feedback software (practise weakest keys but in phrases, big rams etc, ambient analysis during day)

* skill practice before sleep
    * citation
    * stats of how often I followed that (hours graph like GitHub with line of median bedtime for practice days overlayed?) (any analysis?)

* emotional hurdle
